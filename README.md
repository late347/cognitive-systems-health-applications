homework and assignments for neural networks
using python (anaconda)


here is a link also to a kaggle Conv2D neural network I made for case2 exercise with diabetic retinopathy detection.
It was really hard to get practically good results for prediction though! (that sakari's model in the kaggle link, was trained by our teacher, but used against my dataset)

I also made kaggle RNN network with lstm cells, for case3 drug review sentiment analysis, but likewise it was a little bit difficult to get good scores out from the network, the design of these networks is difficult for these for sure...
