homework and assignments for neural networks
using python (anaconda)


here is a link also to a kaggle Conv2D neural network I made for case2 exercise with diabetic retinopathy detection.
It was really hard to get practically good results for prediction though! (that sakari's model in the kaggle link, was trained by our teacher, but used against my dataset)
